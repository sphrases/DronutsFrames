                <b>Update 31.12.17:</b>
                I built the hawk for the first time. Many things need to change.<br>
                - The second top plate prevents access to the usb port.<br>
                - The cam mount is useless (no really, its 20mm to wide).<br>
                - No antenna mount without cam mount.<br>
                It flies <b>AWESOME</b><br>
                With the new cam mount the whole package would weigh 3-4g less (mounted the cam with hot glue)<br>
                I also have a buzzer installed, so that's another 0.5g more.<br>

            <b>What you need:</b>
        </p>

        <ul>
            <li>The Frame and two of the top plates</li>
            <li>8 little standoff-screw combos(3mm nylon/plastic is recommended; height has to be measured to fit the FC
                and receiver)
            </li>
            <li>4 nylon nuts and 4 nylon screws (also 3mm)</li>
            <li>An emax Babyhawk or similar quadcopter</li>
            <li>The 3d printed camera mount(I recommend tpu)</li>
        </ul>
        <br>
        <p class="textblock">
            <b>Preparation:</b>
            <br>
            Check if every hole is big enough to fit the correct screw.<br>
            Use some light sandpaper on the edges of at least one top plate. (to protect the ESC wires)<br>
            You might want to insulate the bottom plate where you want the ESCs to mount with some electrical tape to
            prevent shorts between the carbon and the ESCs.

            Now grab a cool beverage and proceed.<br>

        </p>

            <b>Assembly:</b>
            <br>
            Take the Babyhawk apart.<br>
            (It should be very straight forward, just don't rip anything apart)<br>
            Apply some new double sided sticky-tape to the underside of the FC (soft tape if you want it
            soft-mounted).<br>
            <br>
            Lay the Babyhawk's intestines on the bottom plate, and screw down the motors.<br>
            Next insert the 4 screws in the bottom plate and screw down the 4 of the standoffs.<br>
            Carefully squeeze the first top plate (that you sanded down) between the fc and the bottom plate.<br>
            The ESCs should fit between the bottom plate and the center plate.<br>
            <br>
            Check if everything is layed out correctly and stick down the FC with the tape you applied.<br>
            Now use some electrical tape to mount the ESCs (always use protection, carbon is conductive!)<br>
            <br>
            Use the last 4 standoffs and mount the top plate together with the camera mount...<br>
            <br>
            Here is where I am not sure yet hot to proceed.<br>
            As it seems the top plate might interfere with the cable of the cam... to be continued...<br>
