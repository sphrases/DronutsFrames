        <h2>Babyhawk Frame</h2>
        <br>
        <h2>THIS IS A PROTOTYPE, THIS IS NOT EVEN A BETA VERSION. I DID NOT TEST THIS YET!!!</h2>

        <br>
        <p class="textblock">
            I designed a new frame for the emax babyhawk, due to its heavy vibrations and general lack
            of stability. <br>
            Any kind of feedback or even adaptations of the frame (github, yay) is much appreciated. <br>
            Pictures and a little video of him in action will follow soon.<br>
            <br>
            The frame is designed to be cut out of 1-2mm carbon or glass fibre plastic.<br>
            Personally, I would recommend 2mm for the base plate and 1mm for the two top plates.<br>
            <br>
            The assembly should be *really* easy, you shouldn't need a tutorial.<br>

            <b>What you need:</b>
        </p>

        <ul>
            <li>The Frame and two of the top plates</li>
            <li>8 little standoff-screw combos(3mm nylon/plastic is recommended; height has to be measured to fit the FC
                and receiver)
            </li>
            <li>4 nylon nuts and 4 nylon screws (also 3mm)</li>
            <li>An emax Babyhawk or similar quadcopter</li>
            <li>The 3d printed camera mount(I recommend tpu)</li>
        </ul>
        <br>
        <p class="textblock">
            <b>Preparation:</b>
            <br>
            Check if every hole is big enough to fit the correct screw.<br>
            Use some light sandpaper on the edges of at least one top plate. (to protect the ESC wires)<br>
            You might want to insulate the bottom plate where you want the ESCs to mount with some electrical tape to
            prevent shorts between the carbon and the ESCs.

            Now grab a cool beverage and proceed.<br>

        </p>

            <b>Assembly:</b>
            <br>
            Take the Babyhawk apart.<br>
            (It should be very straight forward, just don't rip anything apart)<br>
            Apply some new double sided sticky-tape to the underside of the FC (soft tape if you want it
            soft-mounted).<br>
            <br>
            Lay the Babyhawk's intestines on the bottom plate, and screw down the motors.<br>
            Next insert the 4 screws in the bottom plate and screw down the 4 of the standoffs.<br>
            Carefully squeeze the first top plate (that you sanded down) between the fc and the bottom plate.<br>
            The ESCs should fit between the bottom plate and the center plate.<br>
            <br>
            Check if everything is layed out correctly and stick down the FC with the tape you applied.<br>
            Now use some electrical tape to mount the ESCs (always use protection, carbon is conductive!)<br>
            <br>
            Use the last 4 standoffs and mount the top plate together with the camera mount...<br>
            <br>
            Here is where I am not sure yet hot to proceed.<br>
            As it seems the top plate might interfere with the cable of the cam... to be continued...<br>
